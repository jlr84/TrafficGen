D-ITG (Distributed Internet Traffic Generator)
----------------------------------------------
Version: 2.8.1 - Revision: 1023
==============================================

D-ITG is a platform capable to produce traffic at packet level accurately 
replicating appropriate stochastic processes for both IDT (Inter Departure 
Time) and PS (Packet Size) random variables (exponential, uniform, cauchy, 
normal, pareto, ...). 

D-ITG supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic generation and it is capable to 
generate traffic at network, transport, and application layer. 

We believe that D-ITG shows interesting properties when compared to other 
traffic generators.


Documentation
=============

Every D-ITG component comes with a syntetic built-in help, which can be 
shown launching them with the '-h' option.

For instructions about how to build and install D-ITG please refer to
the INSTALL file.
